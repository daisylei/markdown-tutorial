# Introduction

This file should give you some practice with creating R Markdown documents and performing analyses with R.

# R Markdown practice

In this section, you will practice using the YAML header to change output types and formatting. You'll also have an opportunity to add CSS/HTML code to make local formatting changes.

As a note, special characters like the at symbol and pound sign need to be escaped with a backslash in order for pandoc to render them as text rather than as functional units when knitting the document. When you try to use these symbols in the practice problems, just remember to remove the backslashes from my explanations.

## Output type

First, let's change this document from a simple HTML document to a presentation. Change the **output** to the HTML presentation format of your choosing (ioslides, Slidy, or `revealjs`). The documentation for all of the different formats is [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html). Remember, if you choose to make a presentation with `revealjs`, you'll need to install the package first.

## Slides

You can create slides with headers by using the pound sign \#. Depending on the presentation format you choose, different numbers of \# will have different behaviors. You can change those behaviors in the YAML header.

You can also create slides without headers by putting four dashes \-\-\-\- on a line by themselves, as below. Try dividing up the text below into different slides.

## Formatting

Once you've changed the document to a presentation, you'll want to do some formatting. All three HTML presentation formats share [appearance and styles settings](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style) with HTML documents in general. Try setting the **theme** and **highlight** styles. Depending on the presentation format you choose, you can also include additional parameters like footers, logos, transition styles, incremental bullets, etc. Refer to the [presentation documentation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html) for more details.

## Bibliography

Let's add a bibliography. We can create citations for the R packages that we're using in this report.

```{r bib}
# Source R script
source("data_cleaning.R", local = TRUE)

# Create bib file with citation information for all loaded packages
if (!file.exists("my_pkgs.bib")){
  
knitr::write_bib(x = pkg_list, file = "my_pkgs.bib", tweak = TRUE, width = NULL, 
    prefix = getOption("knitr.bib.prefix", "R-"))
  
}
```

Now that we've created a bibliography, let's add it to the YAML header. You'll also want to add the citation style language file that you want pandoc to use when creating the reference section at the end. I've included the APA 6 file in the folder for this tutorial, but you could add a different one that you prefer.

When pandoc goes to create the reference section, it needs to know which items to include. If you only want to include items with in-text citations, just use the cite key (the first line in each entry in the bib file) like this [@tidyverse2019]. You can also reference citations like this @plyr2011 without brackets to format it differently. If you want pandoc to include everything in the bib file, regardless of whether it has an in-text citation, add **nocite: "\@\*"** to the YAML header.

As a note, if you knit this document before adding the bib file to your YAML header, the cite keys will just appear as text. Once pandoc has your bib file, it will render the citations correctly.

## CSS/HTML

Let's say that I want to add an image. There are several ways to do this. The most basic markup way combines !, [caption], and (image path/name). Note that the caption will not appear if you do not put it on its own line.

![The Krusty Krab pizza! Is the pizza! For you and me!](images/spongebob_pizza.jpg)

If I want to control its size and position, there are a couple of ways to do this. One is to use HTML code to embed the image and change its formatting. There are other parameters that you can add to this statement to change other properties.

<img style="right;" src="images/spongebob_pizza.jpg" width=40% height=40%>

Another way is to use an R chunk, as shown below. You can change the size, alignment, caption, and other properties of the image by setting the local chunk parameters.

```{r image_chunk, out.height="25%", out.width="25%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Pizza Delivery"}
# This is a chunk of R code that adds an image
knitr::include_graphics("images/spongebob_pizza.jpg")
```

You can also alter other kinds of output, like graphs, from R chunks. Try making a graph below and adding some parameters for the output.

```{r image_practice}
# Create list of f

# Create graph

```
